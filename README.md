# Train-Scheduler

This app uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and firebase to build and retrieve a database of daily train departures.   Users can add a train by filling out the input forms on the lower portion of the page and then submitting.  Upon submission, the firebase database is updated with the new train information, and the table is updated.

"Next Arrival" and "Minutes Away" columns are updated by adding a train or refreshing the page.
